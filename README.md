🕹️ Wolf3D: A Raycasting FPS Game
Welcome to our recreation of the legendary Wolfenstein 3D — one of the first-ever first-person shooter (FPS) games! 🎮

This project is all about building our own retro-style FPS engine from scratch using ray casting techniques, just like the original. It's not just a game — it's a deep dive into the fundamentals of 3D rendering and game development. Cool, right?

🔧 Technologies Used
C programming language

MiniLibX graphics library

Raycasting algorithm for 3D perspective

Custom map parsing and texture rendering

🎯 Objectives
Recreate the core experience of Wolfenstein 3D

Handle player movement, collision detection, and wall rendering

Implement doors, sprites, and a minimap (optional bonus features)

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo

Compile with make

Run with ./cub3D <map.cub>

🤓 Why This Project?
This project challenges us to think like early game developers — turning 2D math into 3D gameplay, optimizing performance, and managing real-time input/output. It’s both a technical and creative journey!
